# Servo-Motor-Opposite-Movement-with-Arduino
This simple Arduino project controls two servo motors to move at the same time but in opposite directions:  • Servo 1 moves from 0° to 180°  • Servo 2 moves from 180° to 0°  Then both reverse their movement in a loop. Great for learning how to control multiple servos using the Servo library.
